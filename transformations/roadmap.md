# Steps from reading file to outputting and saving tiles in a directory
- [] File source (location)
    - local directory
    - server (define db)
- check what kind of file it is jpeg, fits and make sure the images are only those two 
- check if the file path exists depending on what machine egnostic their on
- Make sure the python package we install can run on multiple operating systems
- Make test to check for file corruption
  - Does TensorFlow work for PNG and FITS? => Both images are converted to 'tensors' (vector array STL container: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tensor)

- [] Open a file
  - Check if file exists and in specified directory
- [] Define how much the file is being read
